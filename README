A Speculative Multi-Threading system used to automatically parallelise a piece of
code using runtime dependency checking.

The system is composed of :

  - libyarn    the runtime kernel for dependency checking and task scheduling.
  - yarnc      executable used to analyse and inject code into a source file.
  - yarnb      Benchmarking program used to test perfomances under various conditions.

Building instructions of developpers using git tree. This project uses autotools so the 
usual steps should work just fine:

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make check

Note that the check target currently has linking issues so it will probably fail.
