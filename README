A Speculative Multi-Threading system used to automatically parallelise a piece of
code using runtime dependency checking.

The system is composed of :

  - libyarn    the runtime kernel for dependency checking and task scheduling.
  - yarnc      executable used to analyse and inject code into a source file.
  - yarnb      Benchmarking program used to test perfomances under various conditions.

The build system for yarn uses autotools so developpers can build the project using the
usual steps:

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make check

Note that the check target currently has linking issues so it will probably fail.

Currently, yarnc is not integrated within this build system because it uses the 
LLVM build system. In order to build yarnc, see the README file in the yarnc folder.
