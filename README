A Speculative Multi-Threading system used to automatically parallelise a piece of
code using runtime dependency checking.

The system is composed of :

  - libyarn    the runtime kernel for dependency checking and task scheduling.
  - yarn       executable used to analyse and inject code into a source file.

More will be added here later.
