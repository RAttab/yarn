The compiler component of the yarn project.

Contains the LLVM analysis and transformation passes required to automatically
instrument the target program.


Building LLVM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because yarnc is implemented as optimization passes for LLVM, you will need the LLVM
headers as well as the compiled libraries. More details on how to get and build the
LLVM source code can be found here:

http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html

Note that I recommend using the following flags when calling configure for LLVM:

--enable-assertion --enable-debug-runtime --enable-optimizations

Once configured, you can build the debug or optimized version of LLVM by using:

gmake ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=1


Building yarnc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The build system for yarnc is currently seperate from the main yarn autotools build
because it uses LLVM build system. The full instructions can be found here:

http://llvm.org/docs/Projects.html

Simplified build instructions for developpers are as follow:

autoconf/AutoRegen.sh
./configure
make ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0

AutoRegen.sh will ask that you provide the location of your LLVM source code and
object directory. By default, these two locations are the same. Note that you should
only enter full paths starting from the root of your filesystem.
