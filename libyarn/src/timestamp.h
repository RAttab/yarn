Linearly increasing and atomic timestamp.

Note that this timestamp only garantees consistency in the most common cases and the 
yarn_ts_comp function should only be used if the old_val and new_val were sampled in
reasonable time proximity. In other words, if the timestamp could have been increased
enough times overflow and come back to it's original value then that call will fail.
